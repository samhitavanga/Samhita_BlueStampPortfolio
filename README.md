Over the course of the 6-week BlueStamp Engineering program, I was able to construct the Cokoino Robotic Arm. This robotic arm has the ability to flex and grab objects around it using the help of the servos at each of its joints. You can control the arm in two ways: the 2-joystick controller or on an app on your phone. While the installation and software process encountered some bumps along the road, I am still very proud of the overall end product and its functionality!
